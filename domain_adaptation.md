I've created a comprehensive domain adaptation analysis script with the following key features:

  Script Overview: run_domain_analysis_deeppcb.py

  Core Functionality

  - Zero-shot evaluation of HRIPCB-trained models on DeepPCB
  - Fine-tuning on DeepPCB dataset with optimized hyperparameters
  - Post-tuning evaluation to measure improvements
  - Comprehensive analysis and reporting

  Command-line Usage

  # Basic usage
  python run_domain_analysis_deeppcb.py --weights path/to/best.pt --data-yaml
  path/to/deeppcb_data.yaml --epochs 30

  # With custom output directory
  python run_domain_analysis_deeppcb.py --weights models/hripcb_best.pt --data-yaml
  configs/deeppcb_data.yaml --epochs 50 --output-dir my_analysis

  Key Features

  1. Robust Input Validation
    - Validates weights file existence
    - Checks YAML structure and required keys
    - Verifies dataset configuration
  2. Comprehensive Evaluation Pipeline
    - Step 1: Zero-shot baseline evaluation
    - Step 2: Fine-tuning with optimal hyperparameters
    - Step 3: Post-tuning performance assessment
    - Step 4: Domain adaptation analysis
  3. Advanced Metrics Extraction
    - Multiple fallback methods for different Ultralytics versions
    - Handles both results_dict and box attribute approaches
    - Comprehensive error handling
  4. Professional Reporting
    - Detailed JSON results file
    - Markdown analysis report
    - Organized output directory structure
    - Performance improvement calculations
  5. Smart Analysis
    - Calculates absolute and relative improvements
    - Quality assessment (Excellent/Good/Moderate/Minimal/Poor)
    - Actionable recommendations based on results

  Fine-tuning Optimizations

  - Low learning rate (0.001) for stable transfer learning
  - AdamW optimizer with appropriate momentum
  - Early stopping with patience
  - Comprehensive validation during training

  The script is production-ready with extensive error handling, logging, and professional
  reporting suitable for research documentation.
