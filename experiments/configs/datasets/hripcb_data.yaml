# Training Recommendations
training_notes: |
  - Dataset is balanced across defect types
  - Images are high-resolution PCB scans
  - Annotations follow YOLO format
  - Suitable for attention mechanism research
  - Recommended batch_size: 16 for attention models
  - Recommended imgsz: 640 for balance of speed/accuracy
